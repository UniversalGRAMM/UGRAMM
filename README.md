## GRAMM

- GRAph Minor Mapper (GRAMM) is an novel technique which uses Graph Minor method for CGRA Mapping which significantly speed up the Mapping process.

```

## How to Use:

### Compile:

```
make #Generates a binary called GRAMM in the root directory
```

### Running a circuit on GRAMM:
```
[bhilareo@p181 GRAMM]$ ./GRAMM --help
Arguments are <filename.dot> <numRows NR> <numCols NC> <seed>

# Argument 1: Dot file of the circuit which needs to be mapped (some microbenchmark circuits are provided under microbench/)
# Argument 2 & 3: Size of the CGRA (NR  & NC)
# Argument 4: Seed for the run.
```
